What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	you can commit at when it makes sense. you added a new feature (or part of it), or fixed a bug
	But you may forget to commit
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	in programming you sometimes make small changes in different files, that belong together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Search an find commits, and examine changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	You can also get back to a working version, and check where a bug happened
